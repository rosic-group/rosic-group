- title: "The Hybrid Pathway to Flexible Power Turbines, Part II: Fast Data Transfer Methods Between Varying Fidelity Simulations, to Enable Efficient Conjugate Thermal Field Prediction"

  description: The global drive toward renewable energy is imposing challenging operating requirements on power turbines. Flexible load-leveling applications must accept more frequent and demanding start-stop cycles. Full transient analyses are too computationally expensive for real-time simulation across all operating regimes so monitoring relies on sparse physical measurements. Alone, these sparse data lack the fidelity for real-time prediction of a complex thermal field. A novel hybrid methodology is proposed, coupling data across a range of fidelities to bridge the limitations in the individual analyses. Combining several fidelity methods in parallel; low-order models, corrected by real-time physical measurements, are calibrated with high-fidelity simulations. A newly developed low-order thermal network code is used to predict the thermal field in real-time. High-fidelity flow characteristics are routinely transferred to the decoupled low-order solution. A critical enabling feature of this hybrid approach is the fast data interpolation between differing fidelity numerical simulations. This paper evaluates a spatial Kriging method for robust data transfer between two different fidelity mesh, tested in the case of thermal profile prediction of a power turbine. Additionally, a novel coordinate-based hash mapping process is demonstrated for the fast high-to-low fidelity data transfer. Localized hashing allows independent, parallel, nearest neighbor search at significantly reduced computational cost. The demonstrated method facilitates fast mesh pairing, necessary to support the real-time hybrid method for thermal field prediction during turbine transient operation.

- title: "Experimental and Numerical Study for Improved Understanding of Mixed-Convection Type of Flows in Turbine Casing Cavities During Shut-Down Regimes"
  image: hairpin-vorticies.JPG
  description: Due to an increase in the power generation from renewable sources, steam and gas turbines will be required to adapt for more flexible operations with frequent start-ups and shut-downs to provide load leveling capacity. During shut-down regimes, mixed convection takes place with natural convection dominance depending on the operating conditions in turbine cavities. Buoyant flows inside the turbine that are responsible for nonuniform cooling leading to thermal stresses and compromise clearances directly limits the operational flexibility. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) tools are required to predict the flow field during these regimes since direct measurements are extremely difficult to conduct due to the harsh operating conditions. Natural convection with the presence of cross-flow -mixed convection has not been extensively studied to provide detailed measurements. Since the literature lacks of research on such flows with real engine representative operating conditions for CFD validation, the confidence in numerical predictions is rather inadequate. This paper presents a novel experimental facility that has been designed and commissioned to perform very accurate unsteady temperature and flow field measurements in a simplified turbine casing geometry. The facility is capable of reproducing a wide range of Richardson, Grashof, and Reynolds numbers which are representative of engine realistic operating conditions. In addition, high fidelity, wall resolved large eddy simulation (LES) with dynamic Smagorinsky subgrid scale model has been performed. The flow field as well as heat transfer characteristics have been accurately captured with LES. Finally, the inadequacy of Reynolds-averaged Navierâ€“Stokes (RANS) for the mixed type of flows has been highlighted.

  description: We use our atomic-scale scanning tunneling noise setup on a disordered superconductor, and discover a state above TC that, much like an ordinary metal, has no (pseudo)gap, but carries charge via paired electrons.

  description:
    We develop a simple model to interpret STM results on lightly doped Mott insulators, and find that the effective Mott gap measured by STM correspons to the one measured with other techniques when taking into account the poor electronic screeing.
